### 🚀 Highlight Projects:

## 💰 Crypto Currencies App & Bot 
# Status: ⏳ (In Proggress)
A cryptocurrency tracking and trading bot application built with Node.js, Python, and Machine Learning. It integrates data from TradingView API and a custom API for detecting market indicators (e.g., SMA, Golden Cross, Death Cross) for real-time analysis. The bot uses Binance API to automatically manage buy/sell or long/short positions based on these indicators. Future plans include machine learning with LSTM neurons to improve trading decisions.

## 🌐 Sale Application & Website
# Status: ⏳ (In Proggress)
Developed a complete sales application and website using Oracle APEX, Oracle Cloud, Node.js, and Linux. The website is hosted via Nginx, featuring an SMTP mail service running as a Node.js background process. Additionally, it uses a reverse proxy to manage Oracle Cloud's database URLs, ensuring a seamless user experience.

##🩺 Health Check App 
# Status: ✅  (Done !)
A tool that checks the status of servers and Linux services using Node.js and Shell scripts. It visualizes the service status through an Oracle APEX interface, offering an at-a-glance view of the health of key infrastructure components.

## 💻 API's & Servers 
# Status: ✅  (Done !)
Created a set of fully automated APIs (e.g., currency converter, game room, country info) that leverage Node.js, Linux, webhooks, and GitHub to deploy and manage services dynamically. Webhooks are used to trigger service updates on Linux servers upon GitHub commits, ensuring no manual adjustments are required.

## 💬 Google Backend Chat App 
# Status: ✅  (Done !)
Developed a chat application using Google Cloud with features like Seen, Online/Offline status, and push notifications via Firebase. The front-end was built with Xamarin Forms and C#.

## 🎮 Online Game 
# Status: 🛑 (Not in Use)
Developed a multiplayer 3D game using Unity for the game environment and Node.js for the backend socket server. Players are matched in real-time and send continuous updates of their positions for synchronized gameplay. The project also integrates with the create game room API to manage player matching and game sessions.

## 🧪 Test Automation (Cypress)
# Status: ✅  (Done !)
Created a test automation solution using Cypress and JavaScript to automate the testing of various web applications. This project streamlines testing processes by automating repetitive tasks.

## 📦 Stock Control App
